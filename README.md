## Description

This application is about "building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list". 
MongoDB is used for the database part of this application. "MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data". 

## Motivation for the Project

I have been wondering how a social network like FaceBook, Tiktok, Twitter, etc are designed. This project enables me to have a high level understanding of how these social network platforms work at the back end. It was an eye-opener for me.
